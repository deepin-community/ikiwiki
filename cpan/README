In this directory is a CPAN config file that causes it to install into the HOME
directory, and tries to be reasonably portable. Set PERL5LIB=ikiwiki/cpan to
use it.

This is provided with ikiwiki for use on hosting providers such as
nearlyfreespeech.net, that have CPAN but need some tweaking for it to be
usable by a regular user.
