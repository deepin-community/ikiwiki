[[!meta title="Jonas Smedegaard"]]

Jonas Smedegaard is a Debian developer, like joey. A big fan of this novel approach to wiki: serving as pages static!

JonasSmedegaard maintains the packaging of another wiki - MoinMoin - for Debian, but is personally tired of the heavy burden of Python on his web servers.
