Scott Bronson

### My quest

a wiki that doesn't suck.

### My iki

<http://iki.u32.net>

### Feed

Thanks to [[madduck]], I track this site with the following feed:

[[!inline pages="internal(recentchanges/change_*) and !author(http://sabr.myopenid.com/)" 
feedonly=yes rss=no atom=yes]]

### Tests

* Does this bullet go through?  â€¢   yes, of course.
* Can I create this page?  [[/root_page_test]]
  * no, it's a bug: [[/bugs/Can__39__t_create_root_page]]
* This page has a [[plugins/toc]].  Why doesn't it appear in the edit preview? [[plugins/toc/discussion]]
* Add two subpages: [[sub1]] and [[sub2]] to try to produce a directory listing as discussed in [[todo/pagespec_expansions]].  Will it list?

> [[!inline pages="./sabr/* and !./sabr/*/*" template="titlepage" archive="yes" feeds="no"]]

> How very strange that I need to put the name of my own page in there.  I don't understand that.  But it does seem to work.
