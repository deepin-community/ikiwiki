You're in Ohio.. I wonder if you've any plans to attend the Ohio LinuxFest this year. I've been thinking about going, and it would be nice to meet ikiwiki people. --[[Joey]]

Yeah, definitely! I went last year, it was pretty cool. The only part I was disappointed about was the fact that one of speakers didn't show up (but we got to learn about mod_rewrite instead ;) . I'm only about 15 minutes away, so I have no excuse not to attend ;) Oh, just registered btw. --[[TaylorKillian]]

I'm still thinking about going, maybe I'll see you there. --[[Joey]]
