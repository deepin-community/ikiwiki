It feels like there are a lot of people named Steven Black. While I'm just one of many with my name, sometimes it is actually just me and I've forgotten that I had an account somewhere.

I'm not a doctor, though I would certainly trust any doctor, dentist, or philosopher named Steven Black. (There are several.)

I *am* a huge Ikiwiki fan. I've had my eye on it for many years for personal projects (though I never quite got around to installing it). Recently, however, I managed to convince my coworkers that it would be a good idea for an internal wiki. Boy was I right. The thing is practically designed to be the perfect developer-centered wiki.
