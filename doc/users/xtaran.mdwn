Currently only use it to play around (so no link to any ikiwiki yet), but I really like it and [I see it as a potential WML killer](http://noone.org/blog/English/Computer/Web/WML/Is%20ikiwiki%20a%20WML%20killer%3f.futile). It also reminds me to Blosxom somehow although I think it won't be a Blosxom killer. OTOH I know of people who moved from Blosxom to Ikiwiki as blogging engine. :)

Probably will use it for some parts of my website revamp and for wikiizing my [[/plugins/hnb]] note files.
