Okay, I would like to show here who am I.

I'm Patrick Winnertz, 20 years old (born in 1986) and I was accepted in GSoC 07 to write an latex plugin for ikiwiki. 

I study chemistry in the RWTH Aachen in Germany and in my freetime I work on Debian-Edu and Debian (and now on ikiwiki). ;-)

For some more details about me please visit my homepage at: https://www.der-winnie.de and have a look into the wiki where I develop the plugin:
