Hi,

I'm Taylor Killian, I got selected to work on IkiWiki as part of [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc). My goal is to implement [[todo/wikiwyg]] as a plugin for IkiWiki. I have my own test IkiWiki set up at <http://ikiwiki.xbaud.com/> and will be doing most of my work there.

I am currently enrolled at [Columbus State Community College](http://www.cscc.edu/) as a freshmen and plan on attending [Wright State](http://www.wright.edu/) next year in pursuit of a degree in Computer Science & Engineering.
