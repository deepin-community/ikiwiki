[[!meta title="Paweł Tęcza"]]

My name is Paweł Tęcza. Currently I work as mail system administrator,
C/Perl programmer and computer projects designer at Warsaw University, Poland.

I've founded a few web sites for Polish Debian users and written many
articles for them. The latest and the most famous of these sites is
[www.debianusers.pl](http://www.debianusers.pl/). Unfortunately now
I'm too busy (job, home, woman and child) to care about it.

I've used Debian for many years. My first Debian release was Potato,
but now I rather prefer Ubuntu, because it has faster release cycle
than Debian and I don't want to wait more then 1 year for new stable
release.

I'm also author of unofficial ikiwiki backports. In the past I was
rebuilding ikiwiki source package for Debian Sarge and Ubuntu Gutsy.
Now I do the same for Ubuntu Hardy. You can find this and another
my backports at [public GPA's Ubuntu packages archive](http://gpa.net.icm.edu.pl/ubuntu/).

I love using Ikiwiki and bug reporting ;)
