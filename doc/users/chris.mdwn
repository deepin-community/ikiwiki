[[!meta title="Chris Green"]]

Chris is Chris Green, an ancient C/C++/Java programmer, I started around 1982 or 1983.

I was programming even before that in assembler and things like that, I was first programming for a living in about 1970.

I'm considering using ikiwiki for keeping notes and maybe a ToDo list etc.
