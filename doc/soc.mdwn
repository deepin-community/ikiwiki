[[!meta title="Summer of Code"]]

This page includes information about ikiwiki's involvement in
[Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/).

For SoC 2007, we started with a list of [[ideas]]. Our [[application]] was
accepted, and the following projects were worked on:

* latex plugin input/output for ikiwiki  
  by [[PatrickWinnertz]] 
  (See [[todo/latex]])
* Implement File Upload Functionality and Image Gallery Creation  
  by Ben Coffey  
  (See [[todo/fileupload/soc-proposal]] and [[plugins/contrib/attach]])
* Wiki WYSIWYG Editor  
  by [[TaylorKillian]]  
  (See [[todo/wikiwyg]])
* Creating a gallery of a bunch of images  
  by [[ArpitJain]]  
  (See [[todo/Gallery]])
