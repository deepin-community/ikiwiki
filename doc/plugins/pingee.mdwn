This plugin causes ikiwiki to listen for pings, typically delivered from
another ikiwiki instance using the [[pinger]] plugin. When a ping is
received, ikiwiki will update the wiki, the same as if `ikiwiki --refresh`
were ran at the command line.

An url such as the following is used to trigger a ping:

	http://mywiki.com/ikiwiki.cgi?do=ping
