# Bug with attachments in parent directory

1. Create page '/foo', attach file baz2.png (it will be 'foo/baz2.png')
1. Create '/foo/bar' page with '[[baz2.png]]' contents, this works and shows the image
1. Rename /foo/bar to /iliketrains/bar

Expected result, updated link inside of the page from 'baz2.png' to a relative or absolute path that works.

Actual result, the link inside of the page is not updated. It stays a broken link.

# Can not rename individual attachments files

It looks like I can not rename/move individual attachments files (those that are not pages) using the web interface. I need to do this on the fs. Perhaps that's intended but I am not sure. --[[svetlana]]
