[[!tag type/html]]

This plugin ensures that the HTML emitted by ikiwiki contains well-balanced
HTML tags, by parsing it with [[!cpan HTML::TreeBuilder]] and re-serializing it. This
acts as a lighter-weight alternative to [[plugins/htmltidy]]; it doesn't
ensure validity, but it does at least ensure that formatting from a
blog post pulled in by the [[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directive doesn't
leak into the rest of the page.
