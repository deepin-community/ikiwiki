[[!tag type/format]]

This plugin allows ikiwiki to process pages written in
[WikiCreole](http://www.wikicreole.org/) format.
To use it, you need to have the [[!cpan Text::WikiCreole]] perl
module installed, enable the plugin, then files with the extention `.creole`
will be processed as creole.

The creole format is based on common elements across many different
wiki markup formats, so should be fairly easy to guess at. There is also a
[CheatSheet](http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/CheatSheet).

Links are standard [[WikiLinks|ikiwiki/WikiLink]]. Links and
[[directives|ikiwiki/directive]] inside `{{{ }}}` blocks are still expanded,
since this happens before the creole format is processed. (You need to escape
them manually, via \\\[[directives]], the ~ escaping of creole doesn't work on
this.)

The standard ikiwiki [[WikiLinks|ikiwiki/WikiLink]] is almost the same as Creole link, except that creole uses \[[pagename|description]] while ikiwiki uses \[[description|pagename]].
