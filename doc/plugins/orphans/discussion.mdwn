It seems that the orphans plugin doesn't recognize markdown-style links of the kind:

    [Pretty link name](realname)

In my wiki, the page "realname" shows up as an orphan although it's being linked to.

The orphans plugin fails with an error when it has to deal with a page that contains '+' characters as part of the filename. Apparently the code uses regular expressions and forgets to quote that string at some cruicial point. The error message I see is:

     \[[!orphans Error: Nested quantifiers in regex; 
     marked by <-- HERE in m/^(c++ <-- HERE |)$/ at
     /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/IkiWiki/Plugin/orphans.pm line 43.]]
