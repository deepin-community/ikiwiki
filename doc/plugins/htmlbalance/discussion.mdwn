Would it be possible to use [[!cpan HTML::Entities]] rather than
`XML::Atom::Util` for encoding entities? The former is already an ikiwiki
dependency (via [[!cpan HTML::Parser]]).

I also wonder if there's any benefit to using this plugin aside from with
aggregate. Perhaps a small one but aggregate seems like the main case..
wondering if it would be better to just have aggregate balanace the html
automatically and do away with the separate plugin. --[[Joey]]
