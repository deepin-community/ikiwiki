[[!tag type/format]]

This plugin allows ikiwiki to process pages written in the original wiki
text format. To use it, you need to have the [[!cpan Text::WikiFormat]] perl
module installed, enable the plugin, then files with the extention `.wiki`
will be processed as wiki text.

Wiki formatting is very simple. An item wrapped in three single quotes is
strong. An item wrapped in two single quotes is emphasized. Four or more
hyphen characters at the start of a line create a horizontal line. Newlines
turn into the appropriate tags. Headers are matching equals signs around
the header text -- the more signs, the lesser the header.

Links are standard [[WikiLinks|ikiwiki/WikiLink]], although you can also enable
[[CamelCase]] links.

Lists are indented text, by one tab or four spaces. In unordered lists,
where each item has its own bullet point, each item needs a leading
asterisk and space. Ordered lists consist of items marked with combination
of one or more alphanumeric characters followed by a period and an optional
space. Any indented text without either marking is code, handled literally.
You can nest lists.
