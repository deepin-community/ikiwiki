# Quotation marks inside the title parameter?

How can I use quotation marks inside the title parameter? Is it possible?

I was trying to escape them using backslashes (title="Foo \"Bar\" Baz")
or "cheat" ikiwiki using apostrophes (title='Foo "Bar" Baz'), but unfortunately
no success.

Now I've work-arounded it using apostrophes in another way
(title="Foo ''Bar'' Baz") :)
