This plugin uses [tidy](http://tidy.sourceforge.net/) to tidy up the html
emitted by ikiwiki. Besides being nicely formatted, this helps ensure that
even if users enter suboptimal html, your wiki generates valid html.

Note that since tidy is an external program, that is run each time a page
is built, this plugin will slow ikiwiki down somewhat. [[plugins/htmlbalance]]
might provide a faster alternative.
