This plugin enables a bunch of other plugins -- basically all the ones that
are not too intrusive, work well with little configuration, and are nice to
have on any capable wiki. The plugins in this bundle are not enabled by
default in ikiwiki, so that by default ikiwiki is limited to a few core
wiki features. If you want a more capable wiki, enable this plugin bundle.

Currently included:

* [[brokenlinks]]
* [[img]]
* [[map]]
* [[more]]
* [[orphans]]
* [[pagecount]]
* [[pagestats]]
* [[progress]]
* [[shortcut]]
* [[smiley]]
* [[tag]]
* [[table]]
* [[template]]
* [[toc]]
* [[toggle]]
* [[repolist]]

New plugins will be added to this bundle from time to time.
