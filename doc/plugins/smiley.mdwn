This plugin makes it easy to insert smileys and other special symbols into
pages in the wiki. The symbols are all listed on the [[smileys]] page,
which serves as both configuration for the plugin and a list of available
smileys.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default. :-)
