This plugin changes how ikiwiki handles html files, making it treat html
or xhtml files not as source files but as data files that are copied
unchanged when the wiki is built. Compared with the [[html]] plugin, which
treats html files as source files for the wiki, this plugin allows complete
control over html pages. Note that this means that the html will not be
sanitised of problematic content such as javascript, so it can be insecure
to enable this plugin if untrusted users have write access to your wiki's
repository.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default.
