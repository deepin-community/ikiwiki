Thanks for that one, again, it's great!

One minor thing I noticed, seen on <http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/recent_changes/>:
The links to user pages of e.g. *MichaelBanck* or *GianlucaGuida* don't work, as they're
being linked to <http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/user/MichaelBanck>, whereas it should be
<http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/user/michaelbanck>.

Another one.  If you change the *recentchangespage* configuration option, (it seems to me)
that the pages from the old hierarchy will not be removed from the disk.  But then, changing
this should be a rather uncommon thing.
