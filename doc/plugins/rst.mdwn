This plugin lets ikwiki convert files with names ending in ".rst" to html.
It uses the [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)
markup syntax. You need to have [[!cpan RPC::XML]], python and the
python-docutils module installed to use it.

Note that this plugin does not interoperate very well with the rest of
ikiwiki. Limitations include:

* There are issues with inserting raw html into documents, as ikiwiki 
  does with [[WikiLinks|ikiwiki/WikiLink]] and many 
  [[directives|ikiwiki/directive]].

So while you may find this useful for importing old files into your wiki,
using this as your main markup language in ikiwiki isn't recommended at
this time.
