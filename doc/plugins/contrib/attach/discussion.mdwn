I guess I missed this when the plugin page was posted last September, and
since the [[soc]] stuff wasn't updated, I didn't realize this was Ben's soc
work. Which is more or less why I didn't look at it.

This plugin would need quite a lot of work to finish up, I do think it was
taking the right approach, sorry I never followed up on it.

In the meantime, I've written an attachment plugin that does most of the
same stuff, and behaves closer to how I originally sketched [[todo/fileupload]]
as working.
