This plugin is similar to [[plugins/headinganchors]] except:

 1. it overrides other attributes previously set on heading elements
    (to override the multimarkdown-generated headings for example)

 2. deals with non-ASCII charsets better: for example, 北亰 becomes
    "bei-jing" instead of "z-.E4.BA.B0" and "liberté" becomes
    "liberte" instead of "libert.C3.A9"

This is a separate plugin because this is a backwards-incompatible
change, but I would be more than happy to make a patch to merge this
in the main plugin if necessary.

Also note that *all* heading attributes are overriden with the ID
tag. If this is not desirable, we'd need to fire up a full
HTML::Parser or do some more regex magic to preserve the attributes
other than `id=` which we want to keep. -- [[anarcat]]
