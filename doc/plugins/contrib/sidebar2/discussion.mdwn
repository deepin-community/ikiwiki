More than four years after having written and published this plugin, I kind of regret its name. It should have been called `manybars`, `multibars` or anything like that, but by calling it `sidebar2`, I hijacked the [[plugins/sidebar]] name, preventing the original author to update its own plugin.

Anyway, it is too late to change the name back. I hope I did not offend anyone by doing soâ€¦ Sorry about this.
