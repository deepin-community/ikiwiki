Very neat. The warnings about it not being very secure are of course spot on.
Seems that the need to embed the api key on the page is a security problem of one sort. 

The call to gpsbabel _seems_ secure thanks to the sanitisation done to the filename passed to gpsbabel.

I probably won't ever add this to ikiwiki, but it's a great third-party plugin!

Can this plugin be extended to allow the user to switch the displayed to
many available maps, similar to the functionality provided by
[OSMify](http://blog.johnmckerrell.com/2007/12/31/new-version-of-osmify-bookmarklet/)
which allow replacing maps with one of the [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/) renderings.
