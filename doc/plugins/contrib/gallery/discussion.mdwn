# Adaptation to Newer Versions of ikiwiki

I tried using this plugin, but to no success so far.  I used *gallery* git branch,
rebased it onto the *origin/master*, built a Debian package and installed that one.

However, I can't even get simply things like this to work:

    $ cat web/index.mdwn
    [[!gallery imagedir="b" vcs="0"]]
    $ ls web/b/
    1.jpg  2.jpg  3.jpg  4.jpg
    $ ikiwiki [...] --plugin gallery web web.rendered
    [...]
    $ grep gallery web.rendered/index.html 
    <p>[[!gallery Failed to Read Directory b.]]</p>

When using `vcs="1"` it's no better:

    $ ikiwiki [...] --plugin gallery web web.rendered
    scanning index.mdwn
    internal error: b/800x600-1.jpg cannot be found in web or underlay

--[[tschwinge]]

Its probably because of the restriction of permissions by plugins in newer version of IkiWiki. 
For the time being, you can turn resizing off till I look into conditional underlay directory feature. 

USAGE : [[!gallery imagedir="directory" resize="0"]]

New version updated at SVN REPO : http://ned.snow-crash.org:8080/svn/ikiwiki-gallery/

# Bug With Referring to *js* and *css* Files

In the generated files `gallery/index/index.html` and `gallery/index/*/gallery_*`
it should not be referred to `/js` but to `../../js` and `../../../js`, respectively.
Likewise for `/css`.


# All Thumbnails on One Page

Could `rows="0"` be used to state that all thumbnails should be put on the same page,
no matter how much there are?
