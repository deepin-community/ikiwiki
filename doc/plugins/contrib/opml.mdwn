The idea of this plugin is to parse in an OPML-File and output a linklist, maybe some customization.
OPML-Files are xml-files that most RSS-Readers write out, to summarize their subscribes feedlist.

I have a "dumb" perlscript running on my website, that tries to do a opml2mdwn transformation, but its quite bad on that.

This Plugin is **NOT Ready** in any way. I'm just putting this page up as a hook, to discuss it.

I intend to work on this, but I'd appreciate any help on this.
