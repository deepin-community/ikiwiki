`img` is an enhanced image handling plugin.

the intention is to make image handling as easy as possible, so the
plugin can scale down images for direct inclusion into the page,
providing a link to one or more larger or full-size versions on their
own page. `width` and `height` attributes are included in the `<img>`
tag, and `alt` text can be specified.

the plugin uses the ImageMagick tools via PerlMagick.

it can be found [here](http://www.tahina.priv.at/hacks/img.html).
