This is a [[patch]] to allow filenames that are just the type.  The best example of this is wanting to
pass a `Makefile` through one of the [[todo/syntax_highlighting/]] plugins.  With this patch,
if the plugin can process files of type `.Makefile` then it will also process `Makefile`.

I put this patch on the [[todo/syntax_highlighting/]] page a while ago, but it seemed to get
lost because it didn't have its own bug to track it.  Now it does :).  -- [[Will]]
