When run with the [[rcs/Git]] backend, ikiwiki should use `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`
and `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` rather than munging the commit message.  Depending
on the semantics you want to imply (does a web edit constitute a commit by
the user or by the script?), it could also set `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME` and
`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` to the same values.  --[[JoshTriplett]]
