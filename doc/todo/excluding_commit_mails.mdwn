It would be good to be able to exclude commits made by a given user from
generating commit mails. 

My immediate need for this is because I subscribed to commit mails using my
openid. So I don't get commit mails for changes I make over the web, using
that id. But, if I do a svn commit, that's from a "different" user, so a
commit mail is sent to me. This particular case could be treated as ikiwiki
needing some way to link together openids and other accounts, which could
also be good, but I think the general case of not wanting to see changes
some other user makes is reasonable.

Extending pagespecs for commit mails would be a nice approach. Then I could
subscribe to:

	* and !SandBox and !user(joey)

Insert standard argument about how wonderfly flexible this is. :-)
