(This isn't important to me - I don't use MediaWiki or Creole syntax myself -
but just thinking out loud...)

The [[ikiwiki/wikilink]] syntax IkiWiki uses sometimes conflicts with page
languages' syntax (notably, [[plugins/contrib/MediaWiki]] and [[plugins/Creole]]
want their wikilinks the other way round, like
`\[[plugins/write|how to write a plugin]]`). It would be nice if there was
some way for page language plugins to opt in/out of the normal wiki link
processing - then MediaWiki and Creole could have their own `linkify` hook
that was only active for *their* page types, and used the appropriate
syntax.

In [[todo/matching_different_kinds_of_links]] I wondered about adding a
`\[[!typedlink to="foo" type="bar"]]` directive. This made me wonder whether
a core `\[[!link]]` directive would be useful; this could be a fallback for
page types where a normal wikilink can't be done for whatever reason, and
could also provide extension points more easily than WikiLinks' special
syntax with extra punctuation, which doesn't really scale?

Straw-man:

    \[[!link to="ikiwiki/wikilink" desc="WikiLinks"]]
