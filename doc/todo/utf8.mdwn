ikiwiki should support utf-8 pages, both input and output. To test, here's a
utf-8 smiley:

# â˜º

Currently ikiwiki is belived to be utf-8 clean itself; it tells perl to use
binmode when reading possibly binary files (such as images) and it uses
utf-8 compatable regexps etc.

There may be the odd corner where utf-8 still doesn't work; these are being
fixed as they're found.

Notes:

* Apache "AddDefaultCharset on" settings will not play well with utf-8
  pages. Turn it off.
