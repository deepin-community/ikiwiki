I'd like to speed up the opportunity for people to comment on my ikiwiki, by having the comment-composition form included in static pages, below the existing comments. My initial hacks have been thwarted because the CGI-generated comment composition form has hidden elements with a session ID (a feature of CGI::FormBuilder I think) to prevent exactly this. -- [[users/jon]] [[!tag wishlist]]
