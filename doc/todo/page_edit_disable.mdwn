Disabling some of action URLs is not possible now without creating own
version of `templates/page.tmpl` file. For example, how to disable
displaying `EDITURL`, `RECENTCHANGESURL` or `PREFSURL` without
touching original `page.tmpl` template?

Now I can only enable/disable `HISTORYURL` and `DISCUSSIONLINK`.
It's not hard for me, but I think that the way to do it can be
confusing for another Ikiwiki users. For example, if I don't
want `HISTORYURL`, then I need to comment `historyurl` hash
in setup file. But if I want to disable discussions, then I need
to set `discussion=0` there. So, you can see that we don't have
one common method here.

Maybe Ikiwiki setup file should has more hashes for action URLs,
for example `edit=[01]`, `recentchanges=[01]`, `prefs=[01]`
and `history=[01]`?

If you are curious why I need that features, I can clarify it.
I'm building "parallel" version of my site. It means that I want
to have one editable version for internal users and second only
readable version (+ search feature) for external users. I build
both versions on secure, internal machine from the same pages,
of course, and separated setup files and different templates.
The readable version of the site will be rsynced to clustered WWW
front-ends immediately via `post-commit` hook file or periodically
by Cron. I haven't decided how to do it yet. --[[Paweł|ptecza]]
