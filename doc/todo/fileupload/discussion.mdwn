* Limits to the type of files that can be uploaded. To prevent uploads of
  virii, css, raw html etc, and avoid file types that are not safe.
  Should default to excluding all files types, or at least all except
  a very limited set, and should be able to open it up to more types.

  Would checking for file extensions (.gif, .jpg) etc be enough? Some
  browsers are probably too smart for their own good and may ignore
  the extension / mime info and process as the actual detected file
  type. It may be necessary to use file to determine a file's true type.
