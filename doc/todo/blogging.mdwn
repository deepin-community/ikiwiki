- It would be possible to support rss enclosures for eg, podcasts, pretty easily. 

Here is the last of those items. Using the meta plugin you can give the appropriate 
info, and the enclosure will be added to the entry. It will also add a <link /> tag
at the top, but I don't know if this is necessary. It also includes a fix for
when make is used without PREFIX.

That's fair enough. I'm a little unsure of how it all works, so I just did the
simplest thing I could. 

You don't need a description for podcasts it seems. So there's nothing stopping
you there. 

I have another patch that I think does what you want. It only supports .mp3 files,
.ogg or similar could be added easily. 

It has the disadvantage that the filename is all there is to go on, as I can't
think of a way to associate any information with the mp3 file. I don't 
want to add a dependency on a IDv3 tag library. You could add another file
.mp3.info with the title/description in. 

It's obviously up to you which way you want to go.

Yes I agree that this would be great, but rss2 spec says that enclosure
must have mime-type. How about I use the File::MimeInfo trick from the 
first patch to do this? I don't know why I didn't do this before.
This will probably clean the code up a little as well. 

What do you think of the change that when using raw, if the filetype is not
known it adds an entry anyway? I did this so that the entries appear if
this mode is used. It might be that this is not necessary, as can we assume
that people wont use raw if they want to pod/vid/whatevercast?

I tested with amarok, and that also ignored the description.
I am thinking of those where you have a mixed feed, and people
using clients that ignore enclsures get pretty much a blank post,
with just the filename, and the html page, which also just displays
the filename.

I don't think this is a big issue though, so I guess it's just which
you think is the cleaner interface.

I have also added the first of your ideas as well (though you seem to have
removed it). It adds a parameter to inline `archive_after` which limits
showing full entries to that number.

And here is the updated podcast patch supporting any file type.

<http://jameswestby.net/scratch/podcast2.diff>

And here is a patch for the remaining item. It adds links to the bottom of
inlined entries for edit and discuss (if they are enabled). It doesn't add
links for edit if the filetype is not known. 

The stylesheet should probably be done slightly better than I have. I just
added a bit of spacing as the links were too close to the date. I have no
skill in this area though. Perhaps you would like to use the list system 
that you have for the links at the top.

I'm very happy to report that this is [[todo/done]]. Podcasting patch
applied (finally!) --[[Joey]]
