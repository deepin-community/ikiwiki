It would be nice to have feature parity with [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/).  Note that it is expected that the
implementation will be quite different, but IkiWiki should support the same uses.

Features needed:

 * Wiki, duh.
 * Source code viewing: This can be handled quite well with a [[shortcut|shortcuts]] to an external source viewer, or by putting
    the source in the wiki itself (see the [[todo/automatic_use_of_syntax_plugin_on_source_code_files]] wishlist item and [[todo/syntax_highlighting]] todo item).
    * This could be improved with [[todo/source_link]].
    * Currently the source highlighting is a little problematic, as there can be two source files with the same wikiname.
       e.g. a `hello-world.c` and `hello-world.h`.  See [[bugs/multiple_pages_with_same_name]]

 * Trac 'Timeline' feature: view history of the RCS - the `recentchanges` button.
 * Trac 'Roadmap' feature: Which TODOs/bugs are needed for which milestones.  Use the [[plugins/progress]] directive to show percentage complete for each milestone.
 * Bug tracking: see [[tips/integrated_issue_tracking_with_ikiwiki]] and [[todo/Updated_bug_tracking_example]].
   * Queries on bug database: e.g. all open bugs that don't depend on an open bug.  See [[todo/tracking_bugs_with_dependencies]] and [[todo/structured_page_data]].
 * Build Status: Maybe this is just a link to an external (centralised) status board (e.g. [BuildBot](http://buildbot.net/)).
