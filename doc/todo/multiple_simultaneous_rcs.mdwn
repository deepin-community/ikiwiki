One useful item would be support for multiple RCS systems simultaneously.

Example:

* root refs: git://.... branch wiki
* master refs: git://..... branch master
* dev refs: git://.... branch dev

I'm not sure how the mechanics would work out for choosing between what to refs and managing branch self-references (though doesn't ikiwiki do something like this:

* 1
  * a
     * j
  * b
     * Page : refs a/j
* 2
  * a
     * j
  * b
* a
  * j

Ikiwiki checks: 1/b/a/j, then 1/a/j and succeeds...


The new git subprojects might work, but I've had trouble making them work sanely in the past...
