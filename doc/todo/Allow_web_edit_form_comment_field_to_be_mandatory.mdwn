[[!tag patch]]

In our team internal wiki, we wish to impose a policy that all edits must have a comment. Patch in [[!debbug 450620]].

> Good idea! I also hate empty commit comments, but I know that it's also a matter
> of human mentality. Of course, you can forbid users to commit empty comments,
> but then they can commit so worthless comments like "\*" or "\* blah". --[[PaweÅ‚|ptecza]]

> I don't feel this belongs in ikiwiki core, but would accept a plugin that
> does it. I think that can be done using a formbuilder_setup hook.
> BTW, it wuld probably be better to validate against a `comment_regexp`,
> so that when the evil admins notice that /.+/ is absurdly easy for users
> to get around (by using " "), they can tighten it down. --[[Joey]]

> Sorry for being dense, but I don't see a way to modify the template from within
> a plugin, without providing a whole new template for editform, which obviously
> isn't a workable solution. If the template was modified to allow overriding the
> portion of the message in question, then I agree that a plugin couuld do the rest.
> Thoughts appreciated :) --[[Dom]]

> Yes, modifying the template is ok. --[[Joey]]
