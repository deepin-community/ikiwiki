Hack together a local ikiwiki w/o a web server using w3m's cgi-less mode
and $EDITOR. Browse around a wiki, select pages to edit and get dropped
right into the editor and have the page committed to svn automatically.

[[todo/done]]

Less grandiosely, a simple command line util to add a new page would be
useful, especially if it made it easy to add blog entries to the wiki. I
have a special purpose version of this in my [blog
script](http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/bin.html).
