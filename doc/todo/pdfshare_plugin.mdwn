Given an ikiwiki with a PDF checked into it, how about a plugin that uses [pdfshare](http://ejohn.org/blog/easy-pdf-sharing/) to embed a version of the PDF that uses images and Javascript navigation?  Great for presentations, or any other PDF you want to provide an easy preview of.  The pdfshare plugin should regenerate the images and navigation if you update the PDF.  --[[JoshTriplett]]
