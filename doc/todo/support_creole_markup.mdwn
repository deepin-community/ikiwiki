creole is a wanna to be standard markup for all wikis.

It's an agreement archived by many wiki engine developers.

Currently MoinMoin and Oddmuse supports it. And a lot of wikis (dokuwiki, tiddlywiki, pmwiki. podwiki, etc) have partial support. More info on support:   <http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Engines>


Some useful infomation:

And there is a perl module:   Text::WikiCreole


Syntax file for vim: http://www.peter-hoffmann.com/code/vim/  (Since a typical ikiwiki user usually use external editors. :))
