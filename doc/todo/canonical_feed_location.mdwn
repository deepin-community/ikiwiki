Any way to use `inline` but point the feed links to a different feed on the
same site?  I have news in news/*, a news archive in news.mdwn, and the
first few news items on index.mdwn, but I don't really want two separate
feeds, one with all news and one with the latest few articles; I'd rather
point the RSS feed links of both to the same feed.  (Which one, the one
with all news or the one with the latest news only, I don't know yet.)

>> That wouldn't use the same style for the RSS and Atom links, and it
