The [[plugins/contrib/ftemplate]] plugin looks for templates inside the wiki
source, but also looks in the system templates directory (the one with
`page.tmpl`). This means the wiki admin can provide templates that can be
invoked via `\[[!template]]`, but don't have to "work" as wiki pages in their
own right. I think the normal [[plugins/template]] plugin could benefit from
this functionality.
