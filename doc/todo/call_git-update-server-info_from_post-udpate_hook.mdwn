ikiwiki uses the `post-update` Git hook, which traditionally is being used to
call `git-update-server-info`. This is only needed for HTTP-served
repositories.

It would be nice if there were a configuration option with which I could
instruct the hook to call `git-update-server-info` as well, in the
wrappers['git'] configuration hash (?).
