To avoid the two-step posting process of typing a page name, hitting
"Edit", entering content, and hitting "Save Page", how about optionally
including a post content field, save button, and preview button directly on
the page with the inline?  This would particularly help when using an
inline directive for a comment form at the bottom of a blog post; with
these added fields, the post form becomes exactly like the typical blog
comment form.
