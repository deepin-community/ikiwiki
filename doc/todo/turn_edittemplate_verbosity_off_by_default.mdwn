`edittemplate` replaces its directive with a note like "edittemplate person
registered for people/*". It would be nice if this were dependent on
a `verbose` parameter and default to off. I don't see the value in it, and by
disabling the output, I can keep template registration as close as possible to
the action as needed.

I think this (untested) patch might just do the trick:

[[done]], though the patch I eventually applied uses "silent" as the
parameter name. Sorry for forgetting about this patch until someone else
implemented it too. --[[Joey]]
