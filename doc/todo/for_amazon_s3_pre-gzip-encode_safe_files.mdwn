Regarding the [[Amazon_S3_Plugin|plugins/amazon_s3]]:

Amazon S3 doesn't seem to support automatic GZIP encoding content (such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) that might be compressed by a full-capability webserver.  (I'll also note that NearlyFreeSpeech.NET doesn't support compressing out-going files on-the-fly).  However, Amazon S3 does support setting some response headers, such as Transfer-Encoding and the like.

One possibility of decreasing bandwidth costs/download sizes would be to GZIP all content on the site and set the necessary header... however there are certain browser compatibility issues to be navigated.

Another side item that would be useful potentially would be to have a config option to create a mapping of files that can be gzipped as an alternate name...

For example:

    gzipped_files => {
        js => "js.gz"
    }

Would take all js files and gzip them w/ the altered extension.  *This* could allow for using JavaScript to customize what other JS/CSS code gets loaded in based on browser-detection JS code.
