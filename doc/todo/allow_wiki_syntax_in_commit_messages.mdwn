Commit messages should allow wiki syntax, and RecentChanges should format them
accordingly.

That's a neat idea! It would probably have to be only the simpler bits,
without preprocessor directives -- wouldn't want a commit message inlining
a whole page into RecentChanges. Of course, it could only use _one_ of the
available markups, ie the default markdown. --[[Joey]]

To go along with this, the preview should show the formatted commit message.

This is really easy to do now, but it would have to be limited to applying
markdown formatting (or whatever formatter is default I suppose) to the
content, and *not* to expanding any WikiLinks or preprocessor directives.
Especially with the new static RecentChanges, expanding even wikilinks
would be pretty tricky to do. Applying markdown formatting seems like a
reasonable thing; it would make commit messages that have the form of a
bulletted list be marked up nicely, and would also handle _emphasised_
words etc, and even http links. --[[Joey]]
