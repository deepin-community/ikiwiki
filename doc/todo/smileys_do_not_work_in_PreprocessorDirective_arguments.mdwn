Several [[ikiwiki/Directive]]s take ikiwiki-formatted text as arguments,
such as the `then` and `else` arguments of the new `if` directive, or the
`desc` argument of the `shortcut` directive.  However, smileys do not work in
these arguments.

Since the arguments to [[ikiwiki/Directive]]s might use the same syntax as
smileys for a different meaning, smiley substitution should not happen until
after [[ikiwiki/Directive]]s.
