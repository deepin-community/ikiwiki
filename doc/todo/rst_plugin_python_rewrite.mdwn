The [[plugins/rst]] plugin is slow because it forks python for each page
rendered. Now that ikiwiki supports plugins written in
[[other_languages|plugins/write/external]], it would be excellent if someone
could rewrite the rst plugin as a pure python external plugin. It would
then run nice and quick.

[[done]], thanks to madduck!
