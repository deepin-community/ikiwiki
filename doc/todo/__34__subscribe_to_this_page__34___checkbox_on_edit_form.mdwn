The edit form could include a checkbox "subscribe to this page", allowing a
user to add a page to their subscribed list while editing.  This would prove
particularly useful for [[todo]] and [bug](bugs) items, to allow users to receive
notifications for activity on their reports.

I went and removed commit notification mails entirely, the idea is that you
subscribe using the [[RecentChanges]] rss feed, and filter it on your end.
Good enough? --[[Joey]]
