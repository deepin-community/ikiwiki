[[plugins/edittemplate]] looks for the specified template relative to the
page the directive appears on. Which can be handy, eg, make a
blog/mytemplate and put the directive on blog, and it will find
"mytemplate". However, it can also be confusing, since other templates
always are looked for in `templates/`.

I think it should probably fall back to looking for `templates/$foo`.
