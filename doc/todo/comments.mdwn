# Known issues with the [[plugins/comments]] plugin

## Unimplemented

* Instead of just a link to add a comment, it could have a form to enter
  the title, similar to the form for adding a new blog post.

## Won't fix

* Because IkiWiki generates static HTML, we can't have a form inlined in
  page.tmpl where the user fills in an entire comment and can submit it in
  a single button-press, without being vulnerable to cross-site request forgery.
  So I'll put this in as wontfix. --[[smcv]]

* It would be useful to have a pagespec that always matches all comments on
  pages matching a glob. Something like `comment(blog/*)`.
  Perhaps postcomment could also be folded into this? Then the pagespec
  would match both existing comments, as well as new comments that are
  being posted.

## Done

* There is some common code cargo-culted from other plugins (notably inline and editpage) which
  should probably be shared

  > There's still goto. You have a branch for that. --[[Joey]] 

  >> Now merged --[[smcv]]

* The default template should have a (?) icon next to unauthenticated users (with the IP address
  as title) and an OpenID icon next to OpenIDs

  > {x} and {*} smileys for anonymous, OpenID and login respectively).

* Previews always say "unknown IP address"

  > Fixed in my comments branch by commits bc66a00b and 95b3bbbf --[[smcv]]

* The Comments link in the "toolbar" is to `index.html#comments`, not the
  desired `./#comments`

* Now that inline has some comments-specific functionality anyway, it would
  be good to output `<link rel="comments">` in Atom and the equivalent in RSS.

  > Fixed in my comments branch by d0d598e4, 3feebe31, 9e5f504e --[[smcv]]


* Add `COMMENTOPENID`: the authenticated/verified user name, if and only if it was an OpenID

  > Done in my comments git branch --[[smcv]]

  > Not seeing it there, which branch? --[[Joey]]

  >> Bah, git push --all is not the default... 'comments' branch now (I've also rebased it).
  >> Sorry, I'm on mobile Internet at the moment... --[[smcv]]

  >>> merged by [[Joey]] in commit 0f03af38 --[[smcv]]

* Should the comments be visually set off more from the page above?
  Rather than just a horizontal rule, I'm thinking put the comments
  in a box like is used for inlined pages.

  >> I'll consider this solved by [[Joey]]'s changes. --[[smcv]]

* One can use inline to set up a feed of all comments posted to any page.
  Using template=comment they are displayed right. Only problem
  is there is no indication in that template of what page each comment in the
  feed is a comment on. So, if a comment is inlined into a different page,
  I think it should show a link back to the page commented on.
  (BTW, the rss feed in this situation seems ok; there the link element
  points back to the parent page.

  > done --[[Joey]]

* One of Joey's commit messages says "Not ideal, it would be nicer to jump to
  the actual comment posted, but no anchor is available". In fact there is
  an anchor - the `\[[_comment]]` preprocessing wraps the comment in a `<div>`
  with id="comment_123" or something. I'll fix this, unless Joey gets there
  first. --[[smcv]]

  > done --[[Joey]]

* If a spammer posts a comment, it is either impossible or hard to clean
  up via the web. Would be nice to have some kind of link on the comment
  that allows trusted users to remove it (using the remove plugin of
  course).
