The only way to have a private ikiwiki, with a shared user database
for static pages and CGI authentication, is to use
[[plugins/httpauth]]. It would be good for httpauth to be on par with
[[plugins/passwordauth]], i.e. to allow registering users, resetting
passwords, and changing passwords; supporting some kind of
`account_creation_password` configuration option would be nice, too.

I'll probably propose patches implementing this at some point.
I've not had a single look at the code yet, but it may be nice to factorize
the relevant passwordauth code, instead of rewriting it completely in httpauth.

Well, on such a private wiki, one can neither register herself nor
reset his password: the registration page, as any other page, would be
forbidden to non-authenticated users. Admin users should then be
enabled to:

- register a new user
- reset someone else's password

In both cases, a brand new random password is sent by e-mail to the
new user.

An authenticated user should nevertheless be able to change his
own password. -- [[intrigeri]]
