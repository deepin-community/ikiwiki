It should be possible to configure ikiwiki online, in the wiki admin's
preferences form. Rather than the current situation where most settings are
in ikiwiki.setup, and one or two (like locked pages and upload limits) in
the admin preferences.

In theory, every setting could be configured there. In practice, some
settings, like `srcdir` and `destdir` are ones you want to keep far away
from editing via the web.

The underlying work has been done to privide metadata about all options via
getsetup hooks, so it's just a matter of writing a web interface plugin.

The plugin could have these config options:

	# list of options to include in web setup (safe = all things with safe = 1)
	websetup_include => [qw{safe}],
	# list of options to exclude from web setup
	websetup_exclude => [qw{option_baz}],
	# list of plugins that cannot be enabled/disabled via the web
	# interface
	websetup_force_plugins => [qw{git svn bzr mercurial monotone tla}]

Leaning toward just making it write out to the same setup file, rather than
writing to a subsidiary setup file. However, this would mean that any
comments in the file would be lost, and that it couldn't be used if the
setup file had weird stuff (perl code, etc).
