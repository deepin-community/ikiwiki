Some OpenIDs seen in the IkiWiki git history are displayed poorly in [[RecentChanges]], including mine :-) (`http://smcv.pseudorandom.co.uk/`, shown as `smcv.pseudorandom [co.uk]`)

My `openid` branch on <http://git.pseudorandom.co.uk/> improves on a couple of cases and adds a regression test. --[[smcv]]
