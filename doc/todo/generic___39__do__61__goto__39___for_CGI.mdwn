The [[plugins/recentchanges]] plugin has a `do=recentchanges_link` feature that will
redirect to a given wiki page, or an error page with a creation link.

In the [[plugins/contrib/comments]] plugin I've found that it would be useful to do
the same for users. For now I've just cloned the functionality into the comments
plugin, but perhaps this functionality could be renamed to `do=goto` or
something, and moved to `IkiWiki/CGI.pm`?
