I'll be using IkiWiki primarily as a blog, so I want a way to view entries
by date. A URL of the form `/date/YYYY/MM/DD.html` (or `/date/YYYY/MM/DD/`
when using the `use_dirs` patch) should show posts from that period. ATM, I
have this:

This works (although accessing `%IkiWiki::pagectime` is not too clever),
but it would be far more useful if the date pages were automatically
created and populated with the relevant posts. A [[ikiwiki/Pagespec]] works perfectly for displaying the relevant content, but we're still left with the issue of actually creating the page. What's the Right Way to do this? We could create them in the RCS working copy and check them in, or create them directly in the output directory... (I'd also like to create an option for the tags plugin to auto-create its targets in the same way). Any opinions? :-)

>> Yeah, it wasn't much of a description, was it? ;-) It's an attempt to emulate the style of Wordpress and other popular blog platforms, which can link a post's creation date to  YYY/MM/DD archive pages, which then list all the relevant posts. My use-case is on a blog page which in-lines (via pagespecs) recent blog posts. 

>> I agree with not adding this kind of functionality to the core. :-) I simply didn't want to have break links when I convert to IkiWiki. I guess I'll just play around with the page-creation thing myself then. Feel free to delete this from the queue. :-) --Ben
