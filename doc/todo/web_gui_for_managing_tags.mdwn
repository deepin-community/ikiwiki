Along the same lines as [[default_content_for_new_post]] and [[default_name_for_new_post]] it would be helpful if the default web edit page provided a gui for managing tags.  Being able to manage tags directly via the text box is **wonderful**, but having a dropdown box of available tags can be very helpful in a couple of ways:

 * as a visual reminder to add tags
 * as a cheat sheet for which tags already exist (eg. does this site use "howto" or "tutorial", "hack" or "hacks")

As with [[default_content_for_new_post]] I understand that this falls into a bit of a funny space because making changes via svn would bypass this functionality but I given that the web seems to be the way most non-admin changes are made, it still seems a valuable addition for encouraging people to accurately tag content.

MoinMoin has a simple implementation of this, [click here to see an example](http://www.spack.org/wiki/SandBox?action=edit&editor=text).
