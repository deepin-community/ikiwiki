If RSS and Atom are enabled by default, the [[plugins/contrib/comments]]
plugin generates a feed, perhaps `/sandbox/index.atom` for comments on the
sandbox. If a blog is added to the page, the blog will steal the name
`/sandbox/index.atom` and the comments plugin's feed will change to
`/sandbox/index.atom2`.

If `\[[!inline]]` gained a parameter `feedname` or something, the comments
plugin could use `feedname=comments` to produce `/sandbox/comments.atom`
instead (this would just require minor enhancements to rsspage(),
atompage() and targetpage()).

As a side benefit, [my blog](http://smcv.pseudorandom.co.uk/) could go back
to its historical Atom feed URL of `.../feed.atom` (which is currently a
symlink to `index.atom` :-) )

On sites not using `usedirs` the current feed is `/sandbox.atom`, and we
could perhaps change it to `/sandbox-comments.atom` or
`/sandbox/comments.atom` if `feedname=comments` is given.
