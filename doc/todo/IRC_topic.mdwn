ikiwiki could support grabbing the /topic from an IRC channel and putting the
result in a page.  See <http://wiki.debian.org/TopicDebianDevel> for an
example.  Like [[plugins/aggregate]], the page and its updates should not go
in version control. --[[JoshTriplett]]

A simple script should be able to poll for the irc topic and update a page,
then run ikiwiki -refresh to update the wiki. No need to put that in
ikiwiki or a plugin, though. --[[Joey]]
