When posting a comment to a page, there's a check box to subscribe to get
other comments. There should be a similar check box when editing a page, to
subscribe to all comments to the page (and perhaps to edit notifications of
the page itself). 

Currently, the user has to know how to go into their preferences and
subscribe there. This is not ideal when using ikiwiki for a bug tracker,
etc.
