Currently ikiwiki linkifies text, then runs preprocessor directives. This
allows a directive to contain a wikilink inside a parameter, but since the
wikilink expands to some arbitrary html, the parameter needs to be
triple-quoted to avoid quotes in the expanded text from leaking out. This
is rather non-obvious.

One fix would be to switch the order, since linkification and preprocessing
are relatively independant. Some directives, like inline, would need to keep
on linkifiying the inlined pages, to make the links be resolved correctly,
but that's ok. Any directives that outputed stuff that looked like a
wikilink, but wasn't, would need to be changed.

An alternative would be to change the wikilink regexp so it doesn't apply
to wikilinks that are embedded inside preprocessor directives. I haven't
found a way to do that yet, since perl doesn't allow variable-width
negative lookbehind.

Maybe processing wikilinks and preprocessor directives
as part of the same loop would work, but that probably has its own
issues.
