I've put together an updated bug tracking example.  This example requires some recent
patches of mine.  It requires [[todo/tracking_bugs_with_dependencies]], 
[[todo/Allow_edittemplate_to_set_file_type]] and the second [[patch]] in
[[todo/structured_page_data]] (the data plugin, not the form plugin).

You'll then want to add/replace the following files in the software project example.  The
heading is the name of the file.  I've commented all the directives.  Oh, and I don't
have nice CSS for this yet. I did make sure that if I borrowed
[Trac's](http://trac.edgewall.org/) css then it would display as nicely as theirs - the
html is there if not the CSS.

It might be worth adding some justification of what is going on here.  The datatable
and data directives generate a nice tabular form for the structured data.  The HTML
generated is the same as for Trac, except I've got fewer fields.  Adding more is trivial.

I use data directives rather than links because the data directive allows separating
dependencies from links.  We can specify 'bugs with all dependencies closed' without
being confused by other links on the page.

    ### Description
    
    FooBar does not have enough bugs, which suggests that it's not a real Free
    Software project. Please help create more bugs by adding code to FooBar!
    :-)
    
    #### Steps to reproduce:
    
    Test frobnicate.
    
    #### What I expect to happen:
    
    It should fail.
    
    #### What actually happens:
    
    It works.
    
    #### What I have tried to narrow it down:
    
    I've added some code, but I'm not sure it was the right code.

    ### Description
    
    FooBar, when used with the `--frob` option, fails to properly frobnicate
    output.
    
    > This is fixed in \[[news/version_1.0]]; marking this bug \[[done]].
    
    #### Steps to reproduce:
    
    Use FooBar with the `--frob` option.
    
    #### What I expect to happen:
    
    Lots of frobnication.
    
    #### What actually happens:
    
    Complete lack of frobnication
    
    #### What I have tried to narrow it down:
    
    Tested on Linux, MacOS and NetBSD.
