Pages could have a `linktitle` (perhaps via [[plugins/meta]]), and
[[wikilinks|ikiwiki/wikilink]] could use that title by default when linking
to the page.  That would allow pages to have a simple, easily linkable name
(without spaces, for instance), but use the proper title for links.  For
example, [[ikiwiki/Directive]] could use the `linktitle`
"preprocessor directive", and pages for [[users]] could have `linktitle`s
that put spaces in their names.

Ideally, perhaps two versions of the title could exist, one for general
use, and an optional one for if the case in the actual link starts with an
uppercase letter.  That would allow [[ikiwiki/directive]] to
use the link text "preprocessor directive", but
[[ikiwiki/Directive]] to use the link text "Preprocessor
Directive", for use at the beginnings of sentences.  If the second version
did not exist, the first version would apply to both cases. However, that
also seems like potential overkill, and less important than the basic
functionality of `linktitle`. --[[JoshTriplett]]
