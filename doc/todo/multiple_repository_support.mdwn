I'd like to be able to use one git repository for my basic website, and
another one for the big files (pictures, videos), and another one for temp
files. This way I'd not bloat the basic repo, and I could toss temp files
up, and throw the temp repo away periodically.

For this to work really well, ikiwiki would need multiple repository
support. Possibly it could be tied into 'mr'?

Another thought is that it would be good if ikiwiki could determine the
type of repo a subdirectory is in by itself, eliminating the need to
manually configure it in the setup file.
