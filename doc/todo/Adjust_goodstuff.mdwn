Need to re-evaluate the contents of [[plugins/goodstuff]] based on external dependencies.

* Possibly drop [[plugins/img]] due to PerlMagick dependency, and [[plugins/otl]] due to vimoutliner dependency.
* Add [[plugins/favicon]] and [[plugins/more]] due to lack of external dependencies.

Alternatively, if including items that have minor external dependencies:

* Possibly add [[plugins/table]].
