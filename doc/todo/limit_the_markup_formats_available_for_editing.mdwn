For `aggregate` to work, I have to have the `html` plugin enabled, and this allows users to create `html` pages via the standard edit form. It would be good if I could tell IkiWiki that I don't want certain page types to be editable (but still enabled to let e.g. aggregate/inline work. So by telling IkiWiki that e.g. `html` pages are uneditable (in the setup file), people would no longer

- choose the `html` (or `htm`) page type in the edit form
- bring up the edit form for `html` or `htm`) pages in the first place.
