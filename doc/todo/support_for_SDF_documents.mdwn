I think it would be useful for ikiwiki to support [[!debpkg sdf]] input,
which can be converted and rendered to many formats.
I should add, however, that SDF allows executing arbitrary perl code
from its documents; which means some sanitization would need to occur
before the document is fed to sdf.
