The _bzr_ plug echoes "added: somefile.mdwn" when it adds somefile.mdwn to the repository. As a result, the redirect performed after a new article is created fails because the _bzr_ output comes before the HTTP headers.

The fix is simply to call `bzr` with the _--quiet_ switch. Something like this applied to _bzr.pm_ works for me:

    46c46
    < 	my @cmdline = ("bzr", $config{srcdir}, "update");
    ---
    > 	my @cmdline = ("bzr", "update", "--quiet", $config{srcdir});
    74c74
    < 	my @cmdline = ("bzr", "commit", "-m", $message, "--author", $user,
    ---
    > 	my @cmdline = ("bzr", "commit", "--quiet", "-m", $message, "--author", $user, 
    86c86
    < 	my @cmdline = ("bzr", "add", "$config{srcdir}/$file");
    ---
    > 	my @cmdline = ("bzr", "add", "--quiet", "$config{srcdir}/$file");
