# Use Case *[[plugins/inline]]*

Along the same lines as having a [[default_name_for_new_post]]s, an option
to include default content in a new [[plugins/inline]] post would help with
tasks like using an inline for a comment form on each new blog post.
--[[JoshTriplett]]

No, it would only help if the new blog post were being made via the form.
If you're editing it in vi, and committing, it doesn't help. :-) This is
another reason why I prefer the approach in [[discussion_page_as_blog]].
Although I don't mind getting this implemented too, for other reasons.

I see three possible designs:

1. Simply use the bestlink(new_page_content) as the default content. Thomas
   Schwinge emailed me an implementation of this. It has the problem that 
   it doesn't make sense to use the same new page template for a Discussion
   page as for the page being discussed. (That's a specific case of a more
   general problem.)

1. Modify inline so that "template=foo" uses page foo as the template for
   new posts made to the blog. This doesn't cater to every case, but
   perhaps it would be enough?

1. Make pages able to embed in them a pagespec that says they are the
   template when new pages are created that match that pagespec. 
   This is the most general solution, but depends on
   [[plugin_data_storage]].

This feature would also allow the automatic inclusion of a given template in
every new post, which could help for [[/plugins]] (automatically use the
plugin template), or for [[/bugs]] and [[todo_items|/todo]] (automatically use
a template that appends "(done)" to the title if the page links to
"done"). --[[JoshTriplett]]

> This is a feature I miss a lot from MoinMoin, and is especially helpful when you maintain pages which have a regular format (eg. recipe pages).  I understand that using svn would bypass this feature but I think it's worth considering anyway because:

> * For any given site often it's only the admin user who makes changes via svn, everyone else uses the web
> * It's remote and casual users who benefit most from having standard templates to use for new pages
> * When using svn to make changes it's easier to manually provide template functionality (eg. cp recipe_template.mdwn newpage.mdwn)

> All of course bearing in mind that I'm just commenting because I don't have the skills to actually make the required changes. ;-) -- [[AdamShand]]


# Use Case *Copyright Notes*

Leaving aside the [[plugins/inline]] stuff I have a completely different
use case for this (which is also why I wrote the plugin Joey mentioned).

For a GNU-affiliated wiki we want to track copyright stuff right from
the beginning, as the wiki pages may eventually evolve into official
GNU documentation.

That's why I want to have such copyright notices
be included in every freshly created page by default (and having them
interpreted by another plugin I also emailed to Joey).

Of course this
will also only work when using web-editing, but the people using
rcs-editing (coining new terms, eh ;-)?) usually know what they're doing.
