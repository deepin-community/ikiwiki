Ikiwiki has already been optimised a lot, however..

* Look at splitting up CGI.pm. But note that too much splitting can slow
  perl down.

  > It's split enough, or possibly more than enough, now. :-)

* The backlinks calculation code is still O(N^2) on the number of pages.
  If backlinks info were stored in the index file, it would go down to
  constant time for iterative builds, though still N^2 for rebuilds.

  > Seems to be O(Num Pages * Num Links in Page), or effectively O(N)
