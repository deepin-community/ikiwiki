Git does not support checking out a subdirectory of a repository as a repository.  In order to allow a software project managed with Git to keep its [[wiki,_bug-tracker,_TODO-list,_and_stuff|tips/integrated_issue_tracking_with_ikiwiki]] in a subdirectory of the same repository (rather than a parallel `foo-wiki.git` repository, which does not stay in sync with the code), ikiwiki should support checking out a repository but only using a subdirectory of that repository. --[[JoshTriplett]]
