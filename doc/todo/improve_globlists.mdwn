Need to improve globlists, adding more powerful boolean expressions.
The current behavior is to check for negated expressions, and not match if
there are any, then check for normal expressions and match if any match,
This fails if you want to do something like match only pages with tag foo
that are under directory bar. I think we need parens for grouping, and
probably also boolean OR.
