It's annoying to have to manually run --setup, especially for multiple
blogs, on upgrade. Is the deb is used, there could be a postinst hook to do
this.

Let there be an /etc/ikiwiki/wikis, which just lists setup files and the
user who owns them. postinst loops through, su's, and runs --setup. Voila!
