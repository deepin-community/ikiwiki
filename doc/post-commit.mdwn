If your wiki is kept in [[revision_control|rcs]], a post-commit hook is run
every time you commit a change to your repository.

ikiwiki generates the "post-commit hook" once you've uncommented the relevant
section (under wrappers) in the ikiwiki.setup.

The generated wrapper is a C program that is designed to safely be made
suid if necessary. It's hardcoded to run ikiwiki with the settings
specified when you ran --wrapper, and can only be used to update and
compile that one checkout into the specified html directory.

Depending on your setup, the post-commit hook might end up
getting called by users who have write access to the repository, but not to
your wiki checkout and html directory. If so, you can safely make
the wrapper suid to a user who can write there (*not* to root!). You might
want to read [[Security]] first.

[[Setup]] explains setting this up from the start and see [[rcs/details]] to
know more.
