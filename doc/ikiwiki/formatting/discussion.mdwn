The markdown syntax states that emails are written with html entities, but in ikiwiki only one part is encoded as it.  For reference see <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#misc>.

In the HTML page I get this:

    <a href="mailto:XXXXXXXXXX@gmail.com">&#x6D;&#x6D;&#x61;&#x73;&#x73;&#111;n&#110;&#101;&#x74;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;i&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a>

while it the href="" attribute should also be encoded.
