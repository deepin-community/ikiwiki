[[!meta title="feedfile does the wrong thing from index"]]

When I put the following !inline in my index.mdwn, it generate a file called index/graphics.rss.  However, the link in the RSS button is to graphics.rss (i.e., not in the index/ directory).

`\[[!inline pages="link(tags/graphics) and ./posts/* and !*/Discussion" show="10" feedfile=graphics feedonly=yes]]`
