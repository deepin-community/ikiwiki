If you're using ikiwiki without installing it, the svn post-commit wrapper will die (in a difficult-to-debug way) when it tries to execute ikiwiki.pl because it can't find IkiWiki.pm.

I'm not sure how to fix this in a secure way. For now I'm just changing use lib '.' in ikiwiki.pl to point to the hard-coded directory where ikiwiki was unpacked.

New versions of ikiwiki support installation to nonstandard paths, just set
PREFIX to the path when running Makefile.PL, and it will set up ikiwiki to
look in the place it installed the libraries for its perl libraries, etc.

I don't understand why the wrappers would fail if it were confgured link
that. --[[Joey]]

Ok, well, I'll mark this [[bugs/done]] then. --[[Joey]]
