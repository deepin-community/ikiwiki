Joey, I have a problem with translating of Discussion link in my backport
of ikiwiki 1.38.

I've just noticed that it's not translated after page update. In syslog
I can see **English** ikiwiki messages. It's a strange, but the problem
doesn't occur if I rebuild all my ikiwiki pages via command line
(`ikiwki --setup ikiwiki.setup`). In syslog I can see **Polish** messages then.

Unfortunately I don't know another Polish user of ikiwiki, so I can't ask him
to confirm the problem. Maybe Victor Moral can do it? Probably he uses ikiwiki
with him Spanish translation.
