Ikiwki sends me page change notifications like this:

> A change has been made to <http://joeyh.name/devblog/git-annex_devblog/day_423__ssh_fun/>

This links to a page that says: "The page ?day 423 ssh fun does not exist."

The problem is caused because Joey's devblog includes posts syndicated from his git-annex devblog.

Either the notification e-mails should use the URL of the syndicated post, like <http://git-annex.branchable.com/devblog/day_423__ssh_fun/> or the URL for the post on joey.name should redirect to the git-annex devblog post.
