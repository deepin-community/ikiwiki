If the rst2html procedure of the rst external plugin returns None (e.g. when it throws an exception), then ikiwiki will render

    <div id="content">
    2/8
    </div>

In addition to the broken plugin, this seems like a bug in ikiwiki, which should probably output an informational message about the plugin returning an invalid value.
