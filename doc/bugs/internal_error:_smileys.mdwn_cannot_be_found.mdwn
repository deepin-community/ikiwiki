I've just backported your ikiwiki 1.43 and installed it, but now
I can't rebuild my all ikiwiki pages. When I run `ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup`,
then I can see the following error:

    internal error: smileys.mdwn cannot be found
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 5) line 111.

I have smiley plugin enabled in my `ikiwiki.setup` file, but I've never
had `smileys.mdwn` page.

Probably the reason of the problem is that you've removed many pages
from `basewiki` directory and created symlinks for that pages, but there
don't exist in the last package:

    $ LANG=C apt-cache policy ikiwiki
    ikiwiki:
      Installed: 1.43gpa1
      Candidate: 1.43gpa1
      Version Table:
     *** 1.43gpa1 0
            500 http://gpa.net.icm.edu.pl sarge/main Packages
            100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

    $ dpkg -L ikiwiki |grep smileys.mdwn

This seems to be a bug in your 1.43gpal version, whatever that is.. In the package I built, I see:

    joey@kodama:~>dpkg -L ikiwiki | grep smileys.mdwn
    /usr/share/ikiwiki/basewiki/smileys.mdwn
    joey@kodama:~>ls -l /usr/share/ikiwiki/basewiki/smileys.mdwn
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1643 Feb 13 18:03 /usr/share/ikiwiki/basewiki/smileys.mdwn
