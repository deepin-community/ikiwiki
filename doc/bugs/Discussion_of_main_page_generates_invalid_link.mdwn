The [[index/discussion]] for the main page is located at /index/discussion . In the header ikiwiki generates "ikiwiki / index / discussion" instead of "ikiwiki / discussion" like it should. /index/ contains no index.html file since it is at /index.html instead. The link should either be removed, or a copy of /index.html should be placed in /index/ . --[[TaylorKillian]]
