At least with svn, ikiwiki seems to currently not send commit mails for
newly created pages that match a pagespec such as "*". Subsequent edits to
the same page do result in commit mails.

(Granted, this could be almost considered a feature, if the new page is in
an rss feed..)

Turned out to occur only for web commits that added a new file, since now
the wiki does not rebuild during the commit hook in a web commit, it could
not rely on `%pagesources` having the file. [[done]] --[[Joey]]
