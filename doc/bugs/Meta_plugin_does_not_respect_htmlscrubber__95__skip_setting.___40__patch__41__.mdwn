I have been trying to include some meta info using the link setting something like the below

 meta link="http://www.example.com/" rel="command" name="Example"    

This gets removed by the htmlscrubber as you would expect.

Setting htmlscrubber_skip to the pagespec should stop this getting scrubbed but it does not.

Below is a patch to fix that. It seams to work but I am not sure of it is the correct thing to do.
