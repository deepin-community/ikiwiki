I can't tell yet if this is a problem with ikiwiki, or rather with the web server,
or `w3m`, or whatever.

To reproduce:

    $ LC_ALL=C w3m http://ikiwiki.info/sandbox/

Select *Edit*, log in, have `w3m` spawn an editor for editing the page and notice
that all umlauts and friends have disappeared.  /!\ If the user now saves the page,
the mangled page will be entered into the RCS, so don't do this on the ikiwiki
sandbox page.
