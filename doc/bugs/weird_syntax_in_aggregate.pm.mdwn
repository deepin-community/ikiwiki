		open (IN, "$config{wikistatedir}/aggregate" ||
			die "$config{wikistatedir}/aggregate: $!");

It looks like the intent was "open this file, and die if you can't", 
but I'm pretty sure it actually means "open this file and ignore errors
silently". Shouldn't this be `open(IN, $file) || die "$file: $!";`
(i.e. with the parens before the call to `die`)? --Ethan
