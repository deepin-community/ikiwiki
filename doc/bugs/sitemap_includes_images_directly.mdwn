A bug in the plugin [[/plugins/map]]: It displays images inline.

When I tried, it displayed the one image I have in my small wiki inline in the map. ideally it should link to it, just like it links to pages. [example at my site][uw]. Note that I normally keep images outside, but this time I thought, why not have it all at the same place? (Images are also contextual content (fits to its subpage))--ulrik
