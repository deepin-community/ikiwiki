While I am creating this entry, the following appears
as the page title, above the form:

    ikiwiki/ creating unrecognized "do=blog" CGI parameter when creating todo item

An the following appears below:

    Content-type: text/html
    ikiwiki/ Error
    
    Error: unknown do parameter

This is harmless.
I have to go, but will have a look at what could be going on when I'm back.
