Merging pages to the basewiki causes some odd inconsistencies.  In particular,
if I edit a page, you merge it to the basewiki, and I go to edit it again, the
edit box displays the old text, without my edit. --[[JoshTriplett]]

Funny, I was getting annoyed at this independently, and committed a fix
before I saw this.. [[bugs/done]] --[[Joey]]
