After editing a page `pagename`, ikiwiki redirects to `pagename/index.html?updated`.  Ignoring for the moment that ?updated seems like a bad idea to begin with, this should at least not introduce /index.html into the URL.

> The "?updated" works around caching issues with certain broken browsers,
> web proxys, and/or webservers. These assume that since the "?" is there,
> the page is not static, or is a different page, thus forcing the page to
> be reloaded and the edited version seen. So no, not a bad idea, really.

> http://foo/bar/?updated will redirect to http://foo/bar/index.html, and
> said broken software will then display its old out of date cached
> version.
