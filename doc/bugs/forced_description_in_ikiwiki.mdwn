Hello.

I would like to be able to enable the description of the change to no longer being optional but forced instead simply, when enabled, change to ikiwiki cannot be approved without description (commit message).

I was not able to find it or google it.

Please add such option if it is not in ikiwiki already.

Thank you very much.
