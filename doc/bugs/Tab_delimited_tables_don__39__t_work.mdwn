Table directive should support tab-delimited data, especially important since this is the format you will get if copy/pasting from an HTML table or spreadsheet (Gnumeric, OO Calc, Excel). Test case which fails:

[[!table format=dsv delimiter="\t" data="""
1	2
2	4
"""]]

> They do work, but C-style backslash escapes aren't recognised,
> so the syntax `delimiter="\t"` (as in your test case) looks
> for the literal string `\t`. Replacing `\t` with a literal
> tab character makes it work - here's a test (I changed the data
> to make the table layout more obvious):
>
> [[!table format=dsv delimiter="	" data="""
left	2
2	right
alpha	beta
"""]]
