At [[attachment|plugins/attachment]] plugin page I can see
that it's enabled by default in Ikiwiki. Is it true?

I have backported Ikiwiki 2.52 and I need to add that plugin to
`add_plugins` variable in my `ikiwiki.setup` file (and rebuild
my wiki, of course) to see new upload buttons when I edit a page
and click "Attachments" link.

Maybe should I enable attachment handling in different way?
