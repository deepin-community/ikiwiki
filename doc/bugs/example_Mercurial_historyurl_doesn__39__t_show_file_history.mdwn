The Mercurial historyurl in the example ikiwiki.setup file creates a link to the repo's summary page.  It should take you to the history page for the file, like the example Git historyurl does.

The current historyurl is:

    #historyurl => "http://localhost:8000/", # hg serve'd local repository

A link to the history page for the file would be:

    #historyurl => "http://localhost:8000/log/tip/\[[file]]", # hg serve'd local repository

*The backslash in the code should be removed.*

> To escape a link, use `\\[[link]]`. Example: \[[link]] --[[Joey]]

> ([[done]], BTW)

This creates links to the hgweb page which is equivalent to the Git file history page.
