The search result page uses a wrong path for the css files.

This is, because the search plugin provides $config{cgiurl} as
basepath to the misc template. And so the path to the css 
files ends up to be "$config{cgiurl}/local.css". But this is
wrong if $config{cgiurl} is not the same as $config{url}.

Maybe misctemplate() and misc.tmpl should use an additional
variable which points always to the base of the wiki.

e.g. use "wikibase" for css and favicon and "baseurl" for the &lt;base&gt; tag.
