The new way to confirm ownership of a domain on Flattr is to add a `meta` tag to the page head. For example:

     <meta name="flattr:id" content="4j6y0v">

However, the [[ikiwiki/directive/meta]] directive doesn't allow setting of names with colons.

If I do this:

    \[[!meta flattr:id="4j6y0v"]]

it gets rendered as:

    <meta name="flattr:id=&quot;4j6y0v&quot;" content="" />

I tried [a number of possibilities](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/recentchanges/) and they all failed to produce the correct output.
