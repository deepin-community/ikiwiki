Running ikiwiki had error (ignored and continued):

rebuilding wiki..
Can't exec "ikiwiki-transition": No such file or directory at /usr/pkg/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.0/IkiWiki.pm line 917.
scanning ....

ikiwiki.in and ikiwiki.out have:

$ENV{PATH}="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin";

Please use full-path to installed "ikiwiki-transition" in the system() function or adjust the PATH with PREFIX/bin.

Maybe pm_filter can handle this.

ikiwiki installer already knows about PREFIX.

Not that it matters, but why "if" instead of "elsif"?
