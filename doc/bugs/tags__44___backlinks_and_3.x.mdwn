I think there might be an issue in the backlinks calculation in ikiwiki 3.04.

I've just migrated to 3.04. In doing so, the following pagespec

> "log/* and !link(tag/aggregation) and !link(tag/draft) and !*/Discussion"

...started matching pages which contained

> \[\[!template draft\]\]

The page templates/draft.mdwn contains (amongst some markup)

> \[\[!tag draft \]\]

Prior to migration, the pagespec definitely took effect post-transclusion.

An example: <http://jmtd.net/log/too_much_debconf_a_bad_thing/> contains the
template inclusion, which can be seen to have worked due to markup at the
bottom of the page. It even includes a "Tags: draft" link at the bottom.

Strangely, <http://jmtd.net/tag/draft/> does not contain backlinks to pages
which are tagged using the procedure above.

After the first rebuild, it's broken, after a subsequent refresh, it is fixed.
I've reproduced this twice (but assumed I'd done something wrong the first
time, so went ahead and migrated live, spamming planet debian in the process
:(). I will try and put together a testcase. -- [[users/Jon]], 2009/02/17
