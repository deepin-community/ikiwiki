this example

 * bla
 * bla2

    this should be treated as code block

and it is not ...

    but if bullets are not above this, it works

Is this markdown limitation? I know that 8 spaces are required to make codeblock appear under bullet, but I don't want it to be under bullet. I want it outside of bullet as normally shown (as code block).
