Trying to upgrade to IkiWiki 2.41+ (git head), whenever I try to edit a page I get:

    [Mon Apr 07 16:53:33 2008] [error] [client 68.122.117.135] Undefined subroutine &IkiWiki::escapeHTML called at /root/ikiwiki/install/share/perl/5.8.8/IkiWiki.pm line 610.
    [Mon Apr 07 16:53:33 2008] [error] [client 68.122.117.135] Premature end of script headers: wrapper.cgi

This patch appears to fix it for me:

That's dirty and wrong though... Can you suggest a better fix?  -- [[sabr]]

>> Actually, I do have openid enabled.  Passwordauth is disabled, dunno if that matters.  My setup file is here: <http://iki.u32.net/iki.setup>
