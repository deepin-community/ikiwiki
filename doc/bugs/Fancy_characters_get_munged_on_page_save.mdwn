It doesn't happen on ikiwiki.info but on my site if I enter any of the fancy typography characeters (“,”,…, etc) then when I save the page they are displayed as garbage characters.    I've put an example at the top of [this page](http://adam.shand.net/iki/2007/Test_for_possible_ikiwiki_bug.html?updated).

Sorry, I know the title is ridiculously vague for a bug but I don't know what the proper name the fancy typography characters are. :-/

Thanks for that I assumed it would be Perl foo.  I'll look into the web server config.  Though, just thinking some more ... it's weird that it does the correct thing on preview but not on display.  Hrm ... -- Adam.

**[[FIXED|done]]** - Adding "AddDefaultCharset UTF-8" to my Apache config fixed the problem.  Thanks for the help Joey (especially since it had nothing to do with ikiwiki!).  - Adam.
