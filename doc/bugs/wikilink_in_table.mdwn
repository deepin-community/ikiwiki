I try to create wikilink in table. But it does not work. Here is example:

	\[[!table class=table1 data="""
	\[[wikilink_test|index]]
	\[[wikilink_test\|index]]
	[wikilink test](/servers/webmail1)
	"""]]

First two wikilink entries do not work.

The last one is url link and it works but it is not a wikilink. Or maybe it does not matter if I use URL links in stead of wikilinks for local wiki content?

>> works !! Great!

What exactly is a difference between wikilink and URL reference to the same page ?

Trying to report this I found something weird. I changed in the example [[ with || because wiki renders something wrongly. You can see what I tried originally here:

	\[[!table class=table1 data="""
	\[[wikilink_test|servers/webmail1]]
	\[[wikilink_test|servers/webmail1]]
	[wikilink test](/servers/webmail1)
	"""]]

Please  click edit to see unrendered text. First, it is not monospace-d (I have 4 spaces) and second, some wierd html is shown...
Am I doing something wrong ?
