Using bzr, the dates for changes on the RecentChanges page all start
slightly before the Unix epoch.

Changing line 249 of bzr.pm from

`                        when       => time - str2time($info->{"timestamp"}),`

to

`                        when       => str2time($info->{"timestamp"}),`

fixed this for me.
