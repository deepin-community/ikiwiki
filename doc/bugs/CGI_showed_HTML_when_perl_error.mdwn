I didn't have Time/Duration.pm installed when I clicked RecentChanges. The
perl failed. The CGI outputed the Content-type: text/html and the complete
HTML which included the error in side of the paragraph tags. Maybe a newline
was sent before that Content-type line. The web browser didn't render the HTML
but just showed the source.

Here's what I see, taking the web server out of the picture:

	joey@kodama:~>~/html/ikiwiki.cgi 2>/dev/null |hexdump -C|head -1
	00000000  43 6f 6e 74 65 6e 74 2d  74 79 70 65 3a 20 74 65 |Content-type: te|

No spurious 0a. With apache:

	0100  75 6e 6b 65 64 0d 0a 43  6f 6e 74 65 6e 74 2d 54   unked..C ontent-T

Here the 0d 0a is a CRLF, and note that it's output by the web server, not
ikiwiki. It's perfectly valid, while a lone 0a, just a linefeed, is not valid
HTTP. Conclusion, this was your web server; it's not uncommon for hacky
little web servers to not use proper CRLF's, and it works _some_ of the time,
depending on how strict the browser is.
