I have a blog-like page collecting item, that's ok, display is good, rss
url is correct. In some of the items, I have another rss. When viewing the
item itself, url of the rss is correct. But when viewing the item inside
the main page, the basepath of the rss is wrong, thus the url doesn't go
anywhere.

For example :

(1) a blog-like page which is collecting tag entry :

* address of the page : /tag.html
* address of the rss : /tag.rss

(2) a tag item "foo"
which is containing a rss, listing all the foo-tagged pages.

* address of the item : /tag/foo.html
* address of the rss : /tag/foo.rss

(3) when viewing /tag.html

* the rss url inside tag/foo.html is /foo.rss, not /tag/foo.rss

Is it a bug or did I miss something ?
