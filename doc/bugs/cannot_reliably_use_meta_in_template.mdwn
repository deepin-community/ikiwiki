meta title cannot reliably be put inside a template used by the
[[plugins/template]] plugin. Since meta title info is gathered in the scan
pass, which does not look at the template a page includes, it will not be
seen then, and so other pages that use the page title probably won't use
it. (Barring luck with build order.)

Update: This also affects using tags from templates.

There is a simple fix for this, just add `scan => 1` when registering the
preprocess hook for the template plugin.

However, the overhead of this has to be considered. It means that, on every
scan pass, every page containing a template will cause the template to be
loaded and filled out. This can be some serious additional overhead.
