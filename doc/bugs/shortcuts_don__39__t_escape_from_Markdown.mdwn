Writing [[!wikipedia Low_frequency_oscillation]] causes the word "frequency" 
to show up in italics, since underscores are Markdown for italics. Using
[[!wikipedia low frequency oscillation]] works in this case, because Wikipedia
will redirect, but it's hardly clean. Maybe the shortcuts plugin should
run pagetitle() on the text of its link? --Ethan
