Current git :

        $ perl -c IkiWiki/Plugin/aggregate.pm  
        syntax error at IkiWiki/Plugin/aggregate.pm line 427, near "24;"
        IkiWiki/Plugin/aggregate.pm had compilation errors.

This prevents a Debian package build (due to `t/syntax.t`).

Not knowing the units being used, I don't know where to add the missing parenthesis.
