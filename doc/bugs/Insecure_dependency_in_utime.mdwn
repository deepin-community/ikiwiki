ikiwiki.setup: Insecure dependency in utime while running with -T switch at /usr/pkg/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.0/IkiWiki/Plugin/recentchanges.pm line 158.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 5) line 164.

This was in ikiwiki\_2.32.3.

I worked-around this by doing:

        utime IkiWiki::possibly_foolish_untaint($change->{when}), IkiWiki::possibly_foolish_untaint($change->{when}), "$config{srcdir}/$file

> Don't build ikiwiki with taint checking. It's known to be broken in
> apparently all versions of perl, apparently leaking taint flags at random.
