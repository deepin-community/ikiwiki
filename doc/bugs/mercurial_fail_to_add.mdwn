I don't know what's wrong but I can't add a file with the mercurial backend (the file is created but not added).

Here is a patch that's seems to work, although I'm not quite sure what's wrong with current code :

                    warn "'@cmdline' failed: $!";
           }

My srcdir path has some symbolics links and hidden directorys... maybe that's it ?
