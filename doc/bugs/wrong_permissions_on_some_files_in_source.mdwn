A few files in the source are only readable by root:
ikiwiki/basewiki/favicon.ico
ikiwiki/doc/logo/ikiwiki_large.png
ikiwiki/doc/logo/ikiwiki.svgz
ikiwiki/templates/atomitem.tmpl
ikiwiki/templates/atompage.tmpl

This means that (depending on installation) maybe the permissions are wrong for the final install.
So when ikiwiki is ran (as non-root) it fails.
