If a PNG image matches the [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] of an [[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directive, the page throws the following error:

> \[[!inline Error: Malformed UTF-8 character (fatal) at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/File/MimeInfo.pm line 120.]]

Individual posts display fine, and moving the offending image outside the scope of the [[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directive's PageSpec eliminates the error.
