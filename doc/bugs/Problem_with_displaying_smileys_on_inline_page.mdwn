I've noticed that my browser doesn't display the smileys on a page
where I used inline pluggin. However I can see them when I click the link
to the inlined "subpage".

I checked HTML sources and it seems that Ikiwiki always generate the same
relative path to image file with a smile (`../../../../../smileys/smile.png`),
regardless of the page location. Are you sure it's a right working?

What about if I have main inline page, for example
<http://www.domain.com/blog/> page with 
<http://www.domain.com/blog/post/2008/06/27/foo/> subpage with the smile?

Do you have any idea how to fix it? I dont't want to have multiple
`smileys` directory, of course :) --[[Paweł|ptecza]]
