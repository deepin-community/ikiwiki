By default, tflag is not defined. But ikiwiki.in has -T causing build failure:

perl -Iblib/lib   ikiwiki.out -libdir . -setup docwiki.setup -refresh
"-T" is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line at ikiwiki.out
line 1.

>> Thanks. Now I see. NetBSD and DragonFly and several other systems don't have /usr/bin/perl so that path is replaced in the sh-bang lines of various scripts. So it doesn't match in the pm_filter expression. Can you please consider providing a variable or not matching on that assumed path to perl.

>>> Yes, being more precise should be fine. Note that some may have bin/perl5 or bin/perl5.8.8 for example, so please consider optional number, like ^(#!/.*/perl[0-9]*.*) -T$ or something like that.
