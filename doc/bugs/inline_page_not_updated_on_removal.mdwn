If a page inlines some other page (such as this page by the bugs page), 
and the page is removed (such as by this page being linked to bugs/done),
the inlining page is not updated to remove it.

This only happens if the page is removed from the inlined pagespec due to
a tag changing; the problem is that once the tag is changed, ikiwiki does
not know that the page used to match before.
