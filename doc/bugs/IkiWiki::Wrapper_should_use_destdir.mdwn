In IkiWiki/Wrapper.pm, the gen_wrapper function finds out what srcdir and
destdir are set to in the config, but does not use them.

Later in the sub, when a new wiki.cgi wrapper is being created when calling
ikiwiki --setup /path/to/setup, it will only work if cgi\_wrapper in the
config file is set to the full path. Otherwise, it creates wiki.cgi in the
current working directory.  It works with the other wrapper it sets up in
my config - post\_update (using git), as that shows in the config with a
full path.

One workaround would be to mention in the setup file that cgi_wrapper has
to be the full path, not just the file name, but that seems silly when
destdir is also specified in that file and that's where it should go, and
$config{destdir} is a known value in the Wrapper.pm file.
