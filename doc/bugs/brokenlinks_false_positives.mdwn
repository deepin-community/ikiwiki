The [[plugins/brokenlinks]] plugin falsely complains that
[[ikiwiki/formatting]] has a broken link to [[smileys]], if the smiley plgin
is disabled. While the page links to it inside a
conditional, and so doesn't show the link in this case, ikiwiki scans for
links w/o looking at conditionals and so still thinks the page contains the
link.
