The issue from [[plugins/shortcut/discussion|plugins/shortcut/discussion]] has been fixed.
I wanted to remove the old text from that page, as it serves no further value.
On web-editing I erased all the text, entered a change notice and selected
*Save Page*.
I was, however, thrown back to the web-editing frame, with the old text in it
restored, instead of the page being cleared.
