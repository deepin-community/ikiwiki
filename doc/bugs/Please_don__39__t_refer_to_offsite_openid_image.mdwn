In style.css, please don't refer to the OpenID image on an external site.
This reference allows that site to track users of ikiwikis and other sites
supporting OpenID.  Furthermore, this reference also opens up cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities if the external site did something malicious.  If
the image has a Free Software license, please include it in ikiwiki, in the
basewiki (preferably converted from gif to png).  If the image does not
have a Free Software license, please omit it, and allow users to choose to
add it to their CSS themselves if they find the risks acceptable.
