The following renders incorrectly:

	\[[!toc ]]

	# header1

	content1

	# header2

	\[[!map pages="sandbox"]]


Removing the `\[[!toc]]` directive or moving it at the end of the page
makes the whole wiki page be rendered as expected.

Hint : in all cases, the non-interpreted markdown code is copied as-is
in the HTML output, without any leading `<p>` or any HTML formatting.
