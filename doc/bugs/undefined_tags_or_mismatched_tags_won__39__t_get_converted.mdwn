If you put in something such as undefined tags or mismatched tags in .mdwn file, ikiwiki will put &lt;p>&lt;/p> around them. But ikiwiki will NOT convert < and > to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;! 

     <section>

     some text

     </section>


the output html

    <p><section></p> <p>some text</p> <p></section></p> 

And another example of mismatched tags:



     <div>

     some text

     </div>
     </div>


The out put is:

    <div>

    some text

    </div>

    <p></div></p>

> This is a bug in markdown. Actually, not converting `<` and `>` in tags is a
> markdown feature -- markdown allows inserting arbirary html, even if it's
> made-up tags. And putting paragraph tags around your `<section>` tag is
> understandable, since markdown can't know if `<section>` is intended to
> be a block-level tag or not. The bug is that it puts the `<p>` around the
> trailing `<div>` -- it does know what a div is, and it should know that's
> illegal and not do it. I've filed a [bug report](http://bugs.debian.org/459269) about that issue
> alone. If you feel the other things you brought up are bugs, please talk
> to the markdown maintainer. --[[Joey]]
