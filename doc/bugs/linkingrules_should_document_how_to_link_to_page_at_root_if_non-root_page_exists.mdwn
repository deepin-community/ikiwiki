The [[linking_rules|ikiwiki/subpage/linkingrules]] should document how to
link to a page at the root of the wiki when a normal, unadorned link would
use a page of the same name further down the hierarchy.  For example, how
should [[todo/latex]] link to [[logo]] rather than [[todo/logo|todo/logo]]?

> [[bugs/done]].. the syntax to use is "/logo" --[[Joey]]
