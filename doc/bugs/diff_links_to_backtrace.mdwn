The diff links in RecentChanges go to a viewvc backtrace if the rev in 
question is when the page was added. Is this a viewvc bug, or a behavior 
ikiwiki needs to work around?
  - As a special case, there should certianly be no history link for
    pages generated from the underlaydir as it can never work for them.

Hmm, gitweb deals with this ok, and can even handle the case where a page
was renamed from some other filename. So I don't think it's appropriate
for ikiwiki to worry about this. [[done]] --[[Joey]]
