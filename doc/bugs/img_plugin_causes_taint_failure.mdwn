The img plugin causes a taint failure if one tries to link a scaled image, e.g.

    \[[!img foo.png size=64x64]]

    .ikiwiki.setup: Insecure dependency in mkdir while running with -T switch at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/IkiWiki.pm line 360.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 5) line 109.

If one omits the size argument it works. And if it worked once the taint failure will not happen again unless one rm -r's the destdir.

Seen with ikiwiki 2.30

>> perl-5.8.8, I've created a package for openSUSE. Will file perl bug there as well then.

I've gone ahead and turned off taint checking by default now.
