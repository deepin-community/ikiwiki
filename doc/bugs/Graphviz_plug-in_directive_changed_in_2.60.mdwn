The directive for the graphviz plug-in changed from 'graph' to 'graphviz' in ikiwiki-2.60. Was this intentional?

If yes, the [[plugins/graphviz]] plug-in documentation needs updating, and a heads-up on the news page might not be a bad idea either.

Personally, I like the new directive name better since it will allow us to add other graph plug-ins later.
