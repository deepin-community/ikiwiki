In another blog, I could tag a post with arbitrary words and not have to do
anything else for the software to recognize it as a tag.  In Ikiwiki if you
want to tag something \[[!tag foo]] you also have to go to tags/ and create
foo.mkdn (even if it's zero-length), because "tags are links", and links
don't actually *link* if they have no destination.  This allows for
customization of how you present different tag feeds, but this (to me) is
too much work and more like a category than a tag.  It'd be nice if you
could tell the tag plugin "if the tag target doesn't exist in tags/*,
pretend it does exist and is zero-length". -- [[users/Larry_Clapp]]

Never mind, I think I found the answer (or at least a pointer)
[[here|plugins/tag/discussion/]].  Feel free to delete both these comments
