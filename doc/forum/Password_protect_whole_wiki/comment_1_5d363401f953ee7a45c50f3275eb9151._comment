ikiwiki is a wiki compiler (or a static site generator if you prefer): when it
builds your wiki, the result is static HTML. When a visitor views a page,
no ikiwiki code is running.

If you want viewing to be restricted, you need to configure your web server
(Apache or lighttpd or nginx or similar) to restrict it. For example, if
your web server is Apache,
[this page on Apache access control](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/access.html)
might help.
