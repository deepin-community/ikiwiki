I don't know if I'm doing this right...  I'm using a server provider that doesn't allow me to install into standard perl locations, so I used PREFIX to install things in my home dir.  The problem is that when the wrapper is run by the CGI server, it can't find the perl modules I installed.  There didn't seem to be a way to set the PERL5LIB from the standard config, so I added one.  Patch attached.  Or did I miss something and this was already possible?

>> Thanks!  I found that page, but didn't recognise the importance of INSTALL_BASE.
