I misread \"nobacklinks\" as \"no backlinks\". Turns out setting it to 0 after applying that patch fixes the problem. This whole discussion is now resolved in short term.

In long term, there are a few remaining questions.

- Is .po plugin able to work if the user chooses to use foo/index.mdwn ?
- Is ikiwiki able to move files back and forth when the user toggles the 'use foo/index.mwdn' setting?
- In the case the user toggles this setting, does the .po plugin adapt to the new value (both ways) and move its files around too?
