Did you expect http://svetlana.nfshost.com/irc/freenode/index.en.html to be translatable into Russian and not have backlinks, for instance?

This looks like you have changed configuration/templates and not (successfully!) done a full rebuild since then - but you said \"I think rebuilding the wiki is not affecting this problem\" so presumably you have *tried* to rebuild the wiki, it just didn't work (or didn't completely work). What exact command did you use, and what was its output?
