> Is .po plugin able to work if the user chooses to use foo/index.mdwn ?

Your guess is as good as mine. That configuration is really unusual (I'm not quite
sure why we even have it as an option), and the po plugin is also unusual (not
many people go to the effort of translating their wikis), so it seems likely that
you're the first person to try the two together.

> Is ikiwiki able to move files back and forth when the user toggles the

Not that I know of. If it could, it would likely require you to run
`ikiwiki-transition`, but that tool doesn't seem to have any modes that
seem relevant.

Almost certainly no.
