`page(x)` interprets _x_ as a glob (a wildcard pattern like the ones in Unix and DOS,
with `*` and `?` as special characters), not as a full pagespec. I think you want:

    page(*) and !*/*

which is shorthand for

    page(*) and !glob(*/*)

The only difference between `page` and `glob` is that `glob` accepts both
(HTML) pages and attachments, while `page` only accepts pages. For instance on
ikiwiki installations that use the standard basewiki,

    [[!map pages=\"glob(*)\"]]

matches both [sandbox](/sandbox/) (a page) and [style.css](/style.css) (an
attachment at the top level), while

    [[!map pages=\"page(*)\"]]

matches [sandbox](/sandbox/) but not [style.css](/style.css).
