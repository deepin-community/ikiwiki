just finished setting up ikiwiki..

I can type chinese, save and display it correctly in ikiwiki for the first time. However, when i try to edit the page again, the chinese character in the form is unrecognizable. you can see it here <http://ikiwiki.perlchina.org/>

I am using the latest ikiwiki(manually installed as non-root user) and CGI::FormBuilder(3.0501) on Debian 4.0

这个没问题 it is not a problem on ikiwiki website though.

Thanks.

I have installed locales-all and locale -a shows that zh_CN.UTF-8 is installed(there is no /etc/local.gen file though). then I enabled this line "locale => 'zh_CN.UTF-8'" in my wiki setup and -setup again. but that generated lots error messages "Missing constant domain at (eval 30) line 3"

sorry being a n00b on this thing  what else can I do?
