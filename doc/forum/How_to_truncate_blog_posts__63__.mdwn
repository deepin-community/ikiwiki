Hey,

I'm porting my blog from Jekyll to Ikiwiki and I'm using the default template of Ikiwiki.

As some of my posts are very long it looks weird on main page at the text overflows the box. Also I don't want to show complete blog post on the main page. So, is there a method to truncate  blog posts.

If I'm not clear to you, I want ikiwiki version of [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11044301).
