So I'm trying out ikiwiki locally on a behind-a-firewall server, and I'm having trouble activating themes.  

I added "theme" to my config file's "add_plugins" directive, and uncommented the "theme: actiontabs" line. I then ran "ikwiki --setup wiki.setup" and... no change on reload.

I'm on Ubuntu 16.04. Any idea what I'm doing wrong? --STrRedWolf
