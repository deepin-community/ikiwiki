I have basically been on a similar journey recently. Honestly I would like to move on from IkiWiki myself, and I agree with most of your first points (except the OOP one, which I think is a red herring). I haven't done a deep evaluation of other static site generators, just a shallow one; but I haven't looked at only Python. But results across other languages are much the same. A few core concepts in IkiWiki are very *right*, IMHO: the pagespec/wikilink rules amongst them. -- [[Jon]]
