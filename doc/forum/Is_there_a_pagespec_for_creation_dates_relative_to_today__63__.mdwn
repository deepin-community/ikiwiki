Dear users,


using the directive inline, I want to show all pages (for example named 2008.10.2:foo.mdwn or 2009.12.3:bar.mdwn), whose date in the title are in the future. So in this example only the second one.

I did not find a directive doing this in [[/ikiwiki/PageSpec]].

Does somebody have an idea? I just came up with using a tag “recent” or using a separate folder. But this would be a quite some work to maintain this setup.


Thanks,

Paul
