My ikiwiki setup file configed like:

	usedirs => 0,
	indexpages => 1,

I create a directory and some .mdwn source file  /Whatis/index.mdwn and /Whatis/OSS.mdwn . The html file ikiwiki generated is
/Whatis/index.html and /Whatis/OSS.html . 

But in the page [OSS.html](http://atoz.org.cn/Whatis/OSS.html) , the auto generated link (on the page top)
to “Whatis” is /Whatis.html file , not to /Whatis/index.html. So the link to “Whatis” is fail .

Is it a bug , and how can I do for that ?
