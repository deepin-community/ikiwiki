Hy. STrRedWolf, does your problem already solved ?

- I can't change my themes too, I have uncommented #theme = value, but nothing change. 
- I also have add --rebuild parameter, but nothing change too.

this morning, after long holiday, I came to ikiwiki and solved it after reading [this](https://wiki.math.cmu.edu/iki/wiki/tips/20140720-ikiwiki-navbar.html), he said \"**(Be sure to also enable the theme plugin.)**\",  no one said this before in other tutorial, so I add `-theme` in plugin section and it solved :).

```
 #plugins to add to the default configuration
add_plugins:
- goodstuff
- websetup
- theme
```

now my wiki online using actiontabs theme.

have nice day!. hope it help others.
