**need help please**

I build small wiki for my school, in gntrwiki.azzamsa.com, but I can't apply themes, I have uncomment the theme: value in gntrwiki.setup, but the css file still use anti-theme value, when I copy the css file from actionstabs file it works, but the css will change to anti-theme when we do \"ikiwiki --setup gntrwiki.setup\".

I have follow some tutorial on how to change ikiwiki theme, all of them have the same step, but why I can't achive this ?

*NB*: I have ask this issue in irc, but no one reply. I also get this massage everythime I do \"ikiwiki --setup\"

There are no candidates for merging among the refs that you just fetched.
Generally this means that you provided a wildcard refspec which had no
matches on the remote end.
'git pull --prune origin' failed:  at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Plugin/git.pm line 251.

thanks lot for help, we really need this wiki to be ready soon :)
