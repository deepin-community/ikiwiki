azzamsa: It looks as though your `gitorigin_branch` and `gitmaster_branch` settings
might be incorrect. Set `gitorigin_branch` to be an empty string (`''`) for now.
When you have committed the wiki content at least once, push it to the `origin`
repository with

    git push origin master

then change `gitorigin_branch` back to `origin`.

It might be useful to look at how `ikiwiki-makeremote` does this. In particular,
its first commit is done during setup, contains a `.gitignore` that ignores
the `.ikiwiki` directory, and is pushed to `origin` before running `ikiwiki`
for the first time.
