I'd like my index page of my wiki to show me a list of all the files in the wiki's root and only the names of "folder-pages" (those pages that are named the same way as the folders). I used the map directive to create a list, but I can't come up with a way to limit the depth of the pagespec, so everything inside of the folders is matched and listed as well, which is not what I want. Is there a way to limit the page spec's depth or make it exclude pages in subfolders? I tried `\[[!map  pages="page(* and !*/*)"]]` or `\[[!map  pages="page(* and !foobar/*)"]]`, but both exclude the "folder-pages" (either all of them (first case) or the ones that I have specified (second case)).
