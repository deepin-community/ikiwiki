At <http://svetlana.nfshost.com/index.en.html> some pages are not marked as translatable though I used '*' as po plugin pagespec. Also I edited page.tmpl and commented out the backlinks section, but it still shows on some pages. These two defects are probably related. Please advise how to troubleshoot. I think rebuilding the wiki is not affecting this problem. --[[users/svetlana]] 22:21:46 AEDT February 9, 2017
