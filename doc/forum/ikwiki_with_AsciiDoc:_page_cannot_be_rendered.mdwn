Hallo ikiwiki-team!

I would like to setup ikwiki with AsciiDoc. So far I was able to install the [asciidoc.pm plugin](https://ikiwiki.info/plugins/contrib/asciidoc/) and got it to run.
However when saving a page of Page type Asciidoc I encounter the error:

> asciidoc: ERROR: unsafe: ifeval invalid asciidoc: FAILED: ifeval invalid safe document

This also happens when I afterwards open that page with asciidoc markup. It seems to me that this is a rendering problem!?

Installed on Debian Jessie with ikiwiki version 3.20141016.4

What can I do to make it work?

Cheers!

Dennis
