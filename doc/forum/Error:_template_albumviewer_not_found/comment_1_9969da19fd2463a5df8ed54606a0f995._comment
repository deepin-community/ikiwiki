The album plugin is not exactly polished - it still hasn't been merged into mainstream
ikiwiki despite being written by someone who is now an ikiwiki co-maintainer (me),
because I'm not actively using or developing it at the moment.

I think you might need to use `viewertemplate=albumviewer.tmpl` instead of just
`viewertemplate=albumviewer` - or miss out that parameter altogether, because
`albumviewer.tmpl` is the default anyway. If you use `albumviewer` without the
extension, I think ikiwiki will be looking for an ordinary page (`albumviewer.mdwn` or
something) that contains a [[templatebody directive|ikiwiki/directive/templatebody]],
rather than a `.tmpl` file.

If I'm right about that, the `prevtemplate` and `nexttemplate` parameters are
also going to have the same issue - but you probably haven't noticed that
because the [[plugins/trail]] links let you navigate anyway.
