No, this is not supported. I don't think ikiwiki is suitable for use with your wiki
on that hosting provider.

If you don't need the CGI, you could \"compile\" the wiki offline (on your laptop)
and upload the resulting `$destdir` to the hosting provider - effectively
treating the hosting provider as simple static storage.
