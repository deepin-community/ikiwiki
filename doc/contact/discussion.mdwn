... does not having a mailing list really encourage people to "collaborate
through ikiwiki itself"?  Personally, I strongly prefer to participate in
mailing lists via my mail/nntp client.  I follow over 50 mailing lists, so
if I can't participate in a mailing list mail or nntp, I'll probably just
not participate at all.  I suspect there are others in my situation.  I
think that by not having an SMTP-driven mailing list, ikiwiki is passing up
a big opportunity to build community. -- AdamMegacz

Also see [[this_wishlist_request|todo/provide_a_mailing_list]]. Sure, you can
collaborate with RSS and a wiki, but the ikiwiki community is not only made up
of developers.
