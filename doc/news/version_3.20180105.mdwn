ikiwiki 3.20180105 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * emailauth: Fix cookie problem when user is on https and the cgiurl
     uses http, by making the emailed login link use https.
   * passwordauth: Use https for emailed password reset link when user
     is on https.
   * Remove openid provider icons from login selector, since openid providers
     are increasingly not working. Verisign retired theirs, and aol and
     yahoo/flickr are not commonly used for openid. Any users who still
     clicked those icons to login will need to instead enter their openid url.
   * Updated German basewiki and directives translation from
     Sebastian Kuhnert."""]]
