This MoinMoin converter converts wikis to ikiwikis backed by a git repository, including full history. It simply parses the wiki pages into markdown using the MoinMoin engine.

The converter was originally written by [[JoshTriplett]] and included support for Tikiwiki, for which it parses the wiki pages to HTML then back into markdown using the `libhtml-wikiconverter` Perl package. That original version from Josh is still available from [his wiki page](/users/JoshTriplett). 

The MoinMoin side of things was completely re-written by [[anarcat]] and is currently still in development. That version is available at:

    git clone https://gitlab.com/anarcat/moin2iki/

It doesn't feature support to migrate from Tikiwiki anymore and focuses on MoinMoin support.

Issues can be filed on the [project page](https://gitlab.com/anarcat/moin2iki/), where more information about features, installation and usage is available as well. -- [[anarcat]]
