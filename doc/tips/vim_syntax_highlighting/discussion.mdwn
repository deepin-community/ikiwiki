I'm going to look at merging this with potwiki.vim (a vim-based personal wiki) so that you can follow wiki-links and auto-create pages etc., direct from vim. (I'm writing this incase I don't get around to it) -- [[users/Jon]]

Another attempt at the same thing is here:

In my tests, [[ikiwiki.vim]] works better than that one, YMMV. --[[Joey]]
