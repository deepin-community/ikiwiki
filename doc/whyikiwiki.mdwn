Why call it ikiwiki? Well, partly because I'm sure some people will find
this a pretty Iky Wiki, since it's so different from other Wikis. Partly
because "ikiwiki" is a nice palindrome. Partly because its design turns
the usual design for a Wiki inside-out and backwards.

(BTW, I'm told that "iki" is Finnish for "forever" so ikiwiki is "forever
wiki". It's also nice to note that ikiwiki contains a kiwi.)

Oh, maybe you wanted to know why you'd want to choose ikiwiki instead of
all the other wikis out there? Unless your personal strangeness
significantly aligns with [[Joey]]'s, so that keeping everything in
subversion, compiling websites to static html, and like design [[features]]
appeal to you, you probably won't.

Hmm, the above paragraph is less true today than it was when I wrote it.
